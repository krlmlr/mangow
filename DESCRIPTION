Title: Generate a Manhattan Distance Problem from a Gower's Distance
    Problem
Authors@R: person(given = "Kirill", family = "MÃ¼ller", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "krlmlr+r@mailbox.org")
Description: The transformation of a Gower's distance problem to a
    Manhattan distance problem allows using algorithms that operate
    on the Manhattan metric (e.g., nearest-neighbor search in the
    'RANN.L1' package) on mixed-type datasets.
