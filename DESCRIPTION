        Problem

Authors@R: as.person("Kirill MÃ¼ller <krlmlr+r@mailbox.org> [aut, cre]")
Description: The transformation of a Gower's distance problem to a
        Manhattan distance problem allows using algorithms that operate
        on the Manhattan metric (e.g., nearest-neighbor search in the
        "RANN1" package) on mixed-type datasets.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.2)
