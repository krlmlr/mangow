 abstract = {A general coefficient measuring the similarity between two sampling units is defined. The matrix of similarities between all pairs of sample units is shown to be positive semidefinite (except possibly when there are missing values). This is important for the multidimensional Euclidean representation of the sample and also establishes some inequalities amongst the similarities relating three individuals. The definition is extended to cope with a hierarchy of characters.},

abstract ={This paper is concerned with the representation of a multivariate sample of size n as points P1, P2, …, Pn in a Euclidean space. The interpretation of the distance Δ(Pi, Pj) between the ith and jth members of the sample is discussed for some commonly used types of analysis, including both Q and R techniques. When all the distances between n points are known a method is derived which finds their co-ordinates referred to principal axes. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a solution to exist in real Euclidean sapce is found. Q and R techniques are defined as being dual to one another when they both lead to a set of n points with the same inter-point distances. Pairs of dual techniques are derived. In factor analysis the distances between points whose co-ordinrates are the estimated factor scores can be interpreted as D2 with a singular dispersion matrix.},
