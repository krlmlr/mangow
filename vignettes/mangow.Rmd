Gower's dissimilarity index (Gower, XXXX) is a distance measure for mixed-type multivariate data.
The distance $d(x, y)$ between two multivariate observations $x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n)$
and $y = (y_1, y_2, \ldots y_n)$
is a weighted sum of the distances for each variable $x_i$ and $y_i$;
the weights are chosen so that they are nonnegative and sum up to 1.
The calculation of the distance $d(x_i, y_i)$ depends on the type of the variable:

- For interval-scaled variables, the range is mapped to $[0, 1]$:
  $d(x_i, y_i) = |m(x_i) - m(y_i)|$ with
  $m(z) := \frac{z - z_{\text{min}}}{z_{\text{max}} - z_{\text{min}}}$.

- Ordinal variables are treated like interval-scaled variables.

- For nominal variables, the distance is 0 if and only if the values are equal,
  otherwise it is 1:
  $d(x_i, y_i) = 1 - I(x_i = y_1)$.

- Binary variables are outside the scope of this discussion.

The variable types correspond to R's `numeric`, `factor`, and `ordered`,
and `logical` types, respectively.

Note that the $m$ function introduced above already defines
an embedding into $L_1$ for univariate data.
